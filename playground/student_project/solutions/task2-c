- Difference:
    Pull: The current operator input data is the result of a call to the previous operator's next() method.
          The current operator controls the control-flow, i.e., whether and when next() is called is in responsibility
          of the current operator. Typically, the next() has some kind of return value.
    Push: The current operator input data is given from the previous operator. The previous operator controls the
          control-flow, i.e., the current operator does not know whether and when further input data is send by
          the previous operator (since that might introduce some issues if the current operator must wait for the
          previous operator to finish the output (e.g., hash-join): when the previous operator has no data to
          send anymore, the previous operator can send a message to the current operator to indicate this. See
          Appendix 1 on how we solved that.)
- Data-Flow: No, the data flows from the previous operator to the current operator (i.e., from the current operator
          the next operator); see dashed arrowed lines go from right to left ;)
